# JavaScript Code Quiz

## Description

This repostory was created so I could create a JavaScript Code Quiz that can save/erase the user's highscore, subtract their time when they answer incorrectly, and create/remove HTML elements using JavaScript.

### How did I do it?

I used HTML to create the elements of the initial index.html page and the elements of the initial scores.html page. I utilized Bootstrap and CSS to style both pages. And I used JavaScript to add event listeners, dynamically create more HTML elements, and access local storage.

If you wish to visit this website you can do so via this link: https://emmerz6949.github.io/js-code-quiz/ .



### Installation and Usage

There isn't anything to install as this is just a website that has been deployed.

To use this quiz click on the link in the "How did I do it?" section of this README.md, once the website loads read text on the screen and press "Start Quiz" when you're ready to start. 



### Credits

Some of the styling was thanks to the power of Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/).
